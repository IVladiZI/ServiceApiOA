**#Steps to start the migrations BD âŒ¨**

For migrations we must open the package manager console and set Persistence as the default project.
we place the following command in the console:

**add-migration MyFirstMigration -o Migrations**

This will generate a configuration class for our database to create the tables based on the relationships and configurations that we placed in the Configuration folder of the persistence layer.

If everything is correct we place the following command:

**update-database**

This to execute the configuration class in the database.

**add-migration InitialMigration -Context IdentityContext**

This command will generate the migration of the Identity classes to the database, unlike the first one the -Context is specified because it has two contexts in this case we rely on IdentityContext.

**update-database -Context IdentityContext**

If everything went well in the first migration then this second command is executed to carry out the migration to the database, unlike the first command, in this one the context is specified since there are two
