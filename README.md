**#Steps to start the migrations BD âŒ¨**

For migrations we must open the package manager console and set Persistence as the default project.
we place the following command in the console:

**add-migration MyFirstMigration -o Migrations**

This will generate a configuration class for our database to create the tables based on the relationships and configurations that we placed in the Configuration folder of the persistence layer.

If everything is correct we place the following command:

**update-database**

This to execute the configuration class in the database.
